# Project Name:
            Movie Ticket Booking system
            
            
# Objectives :
    To implement a system that store a movies record and holds a movies list
    and allows the users to book tickets for any movie avilible in the list.
    Morever the the current movie can be deleted and new movie can be added. 
    All the data should be stored in TXT files so that it can be loaded
    when the program restarts.
    
    
# Discription:
     This code implemented a system which holds a movies list (initially empty) , so the user can
     select any movie from the movies menu and books his seats for it. it will tell the user 
     their total amount upon purchasing. The user can check his seat avalibility by using the system 
     function in menu and check weather the seat is reserved or not. The Data is stored in objects
     (because we use OOP) and when the program is closed the data is stored in the TXT files 
     (The Customer data is stored in a separate File and the user data is stored in a separate ). 
     To check for your ticket avalibality for the ticket you have to provide "name" and "ID".
