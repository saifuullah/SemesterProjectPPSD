   menu and book his seats fot it. it will tell the user thier total amount upon purchasing. 
   The user can check his seat avalibility by using the system function in menu and check weather the seat is reserved or not.
   The Data is stored in objects (because we use OOP) and when the program is closed the data is stored in the TXT files
